Description: The asymptotic regression model is often used in the
  analysis of NDF digestion data but the usual parameters are very
  highly correlated.  This package uses an alternative set of
  parameters -- the expected responses at 24, 36 and 48 hours - that
  are more stable.  For reasons we have now forgotten we called these
  Grho.
